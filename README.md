Excel Automation for Sales Performance Analysis using Python

Project Overview
Manual Excel-based sales reporting is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when datasets grow large.
This project automates end-to-end sales data analysis using Python to generate KPIs, charts, and business insights
directly from a raw Excel/CSV input file.

The solution is designed to support faster, data-driven decision-making for managers by providing clean data,
visual dashboards, and actionable insights with minimal manual effort.

Business Problem
Organizations often rely on manual Excel reports to track sales performance across products, regions, and time.
This leads to:
- High time consumption
- Risk of human errors
- Delayed insights for management

This project solves the problem by automating data cleaning, KPI calculation, chart creation, and insight generation
from raw sales data.

- Key Fields:
  - Order Date
  - Product Line
  - Product Code
  - Quantity Ordered
  - Price Each
  - Sales
  - Deal Size
  - Country / City / Territory

This dataset represents a realistic corporate sales environment and supports multi-dimensional analysis.

Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (data cleaning & analysis)
- Matplotlib / OpenPyXL (visualization & Excel automation)
- Microsoft Excel

Input
- Raw sales data file (CSV / Excel)

Automated Outputs
The project automatically generates the following deliverables:
- Cleaned and processed Excel data file

- Highlights top revenue-generating regions
- Reveals seasonal and yearly sales trends to support forecasting
- Supports management decisions with data-backed insights

How to Run the Project
1. Place the raw sales data file (CSV / Excel) inside the input folder.

2. Ensure all required Python libraries are installed:
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - openpyxl

3. Run the main Python execution file.
   This script triggers all analysis modules including:
   - data cleaning
   - KPI calculation
   - chart generation
   - insight and manager summary creation

4. After successful execution, all output files will be generated
   automatically inside the output folder, including:
   - Excel dashboards
   - KPI and insight summary files
   - Manager-ready reports


Project Outcome
This automation significantly reduces manual reporting effort and provides:
- Faster and accurate sales analysis
- Clear KPI tracking
- Visual dashboards for management
- Actionable business insights

The project simulates a real-world sales reporting automation used in corporate data analytics teams.
